title: "A beginner's guide to the Elixir programming language"
description: "Elixir is a process-oriented, functional programming language that runs on the Erlang virtual machine (BEAM). The language was influenced by Ruby. This inspiration can be seen and felt in Elixir’s ecosystem and tooling options. Elixir is known to be easy to learn and widely applicable within the software development industry."

In this section, we will cover:
- What is Elixir?
- Key features, tools, and uses of Elixir
- Intro to Elixir functional programming
- Simple code snippets

### What is Elixir?
Elixir is a general-purpose, functional, concurrent programming language designed for building applications that are reliable, scalable, and easy to maintain. Tt looks a lot like Ruby but offers features that help with handling lots of tasks at the same time (concurrency), recovering from errors quickly (fault tolerance), and low latency.

### Key features, tools, and uses of Elixir

Elixer has many cool features such as:
- Elixir compiles to bytecode for the Erlang VM making it very efficient.
- Metaprogramming with macros and polymorphism via protocols that saves time and effort.
- Emphasis on higher-order functions and recursion
- Handle large data collections efficiently with lazy and asynchronous operations.
- Pattern matching which makes it easy to work with complex data.

The language also has a solid set of web development tools such as:

- Mix: Mix is a build tool that allows you to create projects, run tests, manage tasks, and much more.
- IEx: IEx, Elixir’s interactive shell, provides you with many features like auto-complete, debugging, code reloading, and more.
- Phoenix: Phoenix is known to be one of the best web frameworks. It’s based on the MVC architecture just like Ruby on Rails.

Elixir is great for web applications of any size, web APIs (such as JSON or GraphQL), event-driven systems, distributed systems, internet of things, embedded systems, and much more. 

### Intro to Elixir functional programming

Elixir is a functional programming language, which means it helps you write clear and efficient code. Here are some key concepts like:

- Immutability: In Elixir, once a value is created, it cannot be changed. This makes your code more predictable and easier to run in parallel.
- Functions: Functions are the main building blocks. In functional programming, pure functions are preferred because they use immutable values, depend only on their arguments, don’t have side effects beyond their return values. Impure functions are more complex and can have unpredictable results. In Elixir, functions can be passed around as arguments and return values, making the code very flexible.
- Declarative Code: Instead of focusing on how to solve a problem, you focus on what needs to be done. This makes your code more concise and easier to understand, leading to fewer bugs.
By grasping these principles, you'll be able to use Elixir to build efficient, reliable applications.

### Some basic elixir code examples
These are just examples of elixir basic code snippets.

**Strings**

Elixir uses UTF-8 to encode strings. UTF-8 is a variable-width character encoding that uses one to four eight-bit bytes to store each code point. Strings are surrounded by double quotes, like ”this”. Let’s take a look at a simple Hello, World! in Elixir:
```elixir
IO.puts("Hello, World!")
```


**Atoms**

Atoms are constants whose values are their own names. In other languages, they are called symbols. They’re typically used to enumerate over distinct values:
```elixir
iex> :cat
:cat
iex> :dog
:dog
iex> :fish
:fish
```


**Booleans**

Elixir supports the booleans true and false:
```elixir
iex> true
true 
iex> true == false
false
```


**Arithmetic operations**

You can also do some basic arithmetic operations
```elixir
iex> 2 + 2
4
iex> 10 * 2
20
```
and the divide operator `/` always returns as a float:
```elixir
iex> 8 / 2
4.0
```


**Modules and functions**


In Elixir, functions are grouped into modules. An example of a module is the String module. Here’s an example:
```elixir
iex> String.length("elixir")
6
```

Now that you have learnt what elixir it, you can start experimenting and building simple, small projects that will further drill in these skills you learn and help you grasp them.
