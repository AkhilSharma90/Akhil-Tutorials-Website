title: "File Word Counter"
description: "Elixir is a process-oriented, functional programming language that runs on the Erlang virtual machine (BEAM). The language was influenced by Ruby. This inspiration can be seen and felt in Elixirâ€™s ecosystem and tooling options. Elixir is known to be easy to learn and widely applicable within the software development industry."

This tool will read a text file and count the number of words in it. This project is straightforward and a great way to practice file handling and basic string manipulation in Elixir. You can further adjust this tool to your usecase, like creating your own editor that will have a word count.

Here's an outline of what we'll cover:

## Overview

We'll create a CLI tool named `word_counter` that reads a specified text file and counts the number of words in it. This tool will help users quickly determine the word count of a given file.

## Setting Up the Project

1. Create a new Elixir project:

```sh
mix new word_counter
cd word_counter
```

## Reading the File

Create a module `WordCounter` in `lib/word_counter.ex` to handle file reading:

```elixir
defmodule WordCounter do
    def read_file(file_path) do
    case File.read(file_path) do
        {:ok, content} -> {:ok, content}
        {:error, reason} -> {:error, reason}
    end
    end
end
```

## Counting Words

Add a function to count words in the `WordCounter` module in `lib/word_counter.ex`:
```elixir
defmodule WordCounter do
  def read_file(file_path) do
    case File.read(file_path) do
      {:ok, content} -> {:ok, content}
      {:error, reason} -> {:error, reason}
    end
  end

  def count_words(content) do
    content
    |> String.split(~r/\s+/)
    |> length()
  end
end
````

## Handling Command-line Arguments

Create a module `WordCounter.CLI` in `lib/word_counter/cli.ex` to handle command-line interaction:

```elixir
defmodule WordCounter.CLI do
  def main(args) do
    case parse_args(args) do
      {:ok, file_path} -> process_file(file_path)
      {:error, message} -> IO.puts(message)
    end
  end

  defp parse_args([file_path]) when is_binary(file_path), do: {:ok, file_path}
  defp parse_args(_), do: {:error, "Usage: word_counter <file_path>"}

  defp process_file(file_path) do
    case WordCounter.read_file(file_path) do
      {:ok, content} ->
        word_count = WordCounter.count_words(content)
        IO.puts("The file contains #{word_count} words.")

      {:error, reason} ->
        IO.puts("Failed to read file: #{reason}")
    end
  end
end

```

Modify the `mix.exs` file to set the `escript` options so that the project can be run as a standalone executable:

```elixir
defmodule WordCounter.MixProject do
    use Mix.Project

    def project do
    [
        app: :word_counter,
        version: "0.1.0",
        elixir: "~> 1.11",
        start_permanent: Mix.env() == :prod,
        deps: deps(),
        escript: escript()
    ]
    end

    defp escript do
    [main_module: WordCounter.CLI]
    end

    defp deps do
    []
    end
end
```

## Running the program

Even though we don't have any dependencies in this project, it's always a good idea to run this command to ensure everything is up-to-date:

```sh
mix deps.get
```

Now, running this command will produce and executable for the tool.

```sh
mix escript.build
```

After that, run the executable with the path to your file. For this case, simple create a file named `demo.txt` on your root project, and run the following command:

```sh
./word_counter demo.txt
```

You should see and output like:

```bash
The file contains 2 words.
```

## Conclusion

You've built a simple and useful CLI tool in Elixir that reads a text file and counts the number of words. This project demonstrates basic file handling, string manipulation, and command-line interaction in Elixir.
