## Core Concepts in OCaml

### Data Types and Variables

OCaml supports several basic data types:

- **Integers:** `let a = 5`
- **Floating-point numbers:** `let b = 5.0`
- **Strings:** `let c = "Hello"`
- **Booleans:** `let d = true`

Variable declaration in OCaml is immutable by default, which means once a value is assigned to a variable, it cannot be changed.

### Control Structures

OCaml includes several control structures for decision-making and looping:

- **If-Else Statements:**
  ```ocaml
  if x > 5 then
    "Greater"
  else
    "Smaller"
  ```

- **Loops:** While loops and for loops are used for iterative operations. However, functional programming encourages recursion over imperative loops.

### Functions and Recursion

Functions in OCaml are first-class citizens and can be passed around just like any other value. A simple function definition looks like this:

```ocaml
let add a b = a + b;;
```

Recursion is a fundamental concept in functional programming. Here's a simple example of a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a number:

```ocaml
let rec factorial n =
  if n = 0 then 1 else n * factorial (n - 1);;
```

## Code Example: Simple Calculator

Here's a basic calculator in OCaml performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:

```ocaml
let add a b = a + b;;
let subtract a b = a - b;;
let multiply a b = a * b;;
let divide a b = a / b;;
```

Usage:

```ocaml
let sum = add 5 3;;
let difference = subtract 5 3;;
let product = multiply 5 3;;
let quotient = divide 5 3;;
```

This example demonstrates basic function definitions and arithmetic operations in OCaml.
