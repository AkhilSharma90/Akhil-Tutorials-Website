File manipulation in OCaml revolves around the concept of channels, which are used for both reading from and writing to files. Here's a breakdown of the basic file manipulation operations:

### Writing to a File

To write data into a file:

1. **Open the File**: Use functions like `open_out` or `open_out_bin` to obtain an output channel (`out_channel`).
2. **Write to the Channel**: Use functions like `Printf.fprintf` to write data into the channel.
3. **Flush the Channel**: If you want to ensure immediate writing to the physical device, call `flush` on the channel.
4. **Close the Channel**: Use `close_out` or `close_out_noerr` to close the channel, which also flushes it automatically.

### Reading from a File

To read data from a file:

1. **Open the File**: Use functions like `open_in` or `open_in_bin` to obtain an input channel (`in_channel`).
2. **Read from the Channel**: Use functions like `input_line` to read data from the channel.
3. **Handle End of File**: When there are no more characters to read, the `End_of_file` exception is raised. Catch this exception and close the channel.
4. **Close the Channel**: Use `close_in` or `close_in_noerr` to close the channel.

### Seeking

You can manipulate the current position within a file using `seek_in` or `seek_out` functions. This allows you to skip to a particular position or restart reading from the beginning.

### Gotchas

- **Flush Output Channels**: Remember to flush output channels to ensure data is written immediately.
- **Close Unused Channels**: Close any unused channels to avoid exceeding the operating system's limit on open files.
- **Use Correct Channels**: Be mindful of using the correct channels, especially when dealing with standard channels like `stdout`, `stdin`, and `stderr`.
- **Truncation with `open_out`**: `open_out` truncates the file if it already exists. Use `open_out_gen` for alternate behavior.

### Example

```ocaml
let file = "example.dat"
let message = "Hello!"

let () =
  (* Write message to file *)
  let oc = open_out file in
  (* create or truncate file, return channel *)
  Printf.fprintf oc "%s\n" message;
  (* write something *)
  close_out oc;

  (* flush and close the channel *)

  (* Read file and display the first line *)
  let ic = open_in file in
  try
    let line = input_line ic in
    (* read line, discard \n *)
    print_endline line;
    (* write the result to stdout *)
    flush stdout;
    (* write on the underlying device now *)
    close_in ic
    (* close the input channel *)
  with e ->
    (* some unexpected exception occurs *)
    close_in_noerr ic;
    (* emergency closing *)
    raise e

(* exit with error: files are closed but channels are not flushed *)

(* normal exit: all channels are flushed and closed *)
```

### Compilation and Execution

```bash
$ ocamlopt -o file_manip file_manip.ml
$ ./file_manip
Hello!
```

This example demonstrates writing a message to a file and then reading the file to display its content.
