## Functional Programming in Scala

Scala's support for functional programming (FP) emphasizes writing software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects.

**Understanding Functional Programming**

Functional programming treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions. It emphasizes the use of immutable data and functions as first-class citizens.

- **Immutable Collections:** Scala provides a rich set of immutable collections, making code safer and easier to understand.
- **Higher-Order Functions:** Higher-order functions can take functions as parameters or return functions, and they are critical in FP.

**Immutable Collections**

Scala provides several immutable collections:

- **List:** An immutable sequence.
  ```scala
  val numbers = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
  ```

- **Vector:** An immutable indexed sequence.
  ```scala
  val vector = Vector(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
  ```

- **Map:** An immutable map of key-value pairs.
  ```scala
  val map = Map("Alice" -> 25, "Bob" -> 30)
  ```

**Higher-Order Functions**

Scala's higher-order functions include `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.

- **map:** Transforms each element in a collection.
  ```scala
  val doubled = numbers.map(_ * 2)
  ```

- **filter:** Returns elements of a collection that meet a condition.
  ```scala
  val evenNumbers = numbers.filter(_ % 2 == 0)
  ```

- **reduce:** Combines all elements of a collection using a binary function.
  ```scala
  val sum = numbers.reduce(_ + _)
  ```

**Code Example: Scala Functional Programming**

Here's a Scala program demonstrating functional programming concepts:

```scala
object FunctionalApp {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val numbers = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    val doubled = numbers.map(_ * 2)
    println(s"Doubled Numbers: $doubled")
    val evenNumbers = numbers.filter(_ % 2 == 0)
    println(s"Even Numbers: $evenNumbers")
    val sum = numbers.reduce(_ + _)
    println(s"Sum of Numbers: $sum")
  }
}
```

This program showcases the use of `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` functions on a list of numbers.
