## What is Systems Design?

Systems Design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. It involves translating user requirements into a detailed blueprint that guides the implementation phase. The goal is to create a well-organized and efficient structure that meets the intended purpose while considering factors like scalability, maintainability, and performance.

Mastering Systems Design is crucial for anyone looking to build robust and scalable systems. Through practical examples and expert insights, youâ€™ll learn how to effectively translate user requirements into detailed designs that can be successfully implemented.

## Why Learn System Design?

In any development process, be it software or any other technology, the most important stage is the design. Without the designing phase, you cannot jump to the implementation or the testing part. Systems Design not only is a vital step in the development of the system but also provides the backbone to handle exceptional scenarios because it represents the business logic of the software. It is clear that system design acts as a backbone because no matter how well the coding part is executed, it later becomes irrelevant if the corresponding design is not good.

### Objectives of Systems Design

- **Practicality**: Targeting the audience for whom the system is designed.
- **Accuracy**: Fulfilling nearly all functional and non-functional requirements.
- **Completeness**: Meeting all user requirements.
- **Efficiency**: Optimizing resource usage to achieve high throughput and low latency.
- **Reliability**: Ensuring the system operates in a failure-free environment for a certain period.
- **Optimization**: Balancing time and space efficiency for individual components.
- **Scalability**: Adapting to changing user needs over time, ensuring long-term success.

### Advantages of System Design

- **Reduces design cost** of a product.
- **Accelerates the software development process.**
- **Saves overall time** in the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
- **Increases efficiency** and consistency for programmers.
- **Conserves resources**.

## Components of Systems Design

### Load Balancers

Load balancers are crucial for ensuring scalability, availability, and performance. They distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers to prevent any single server from becoming a bottleneck.

### Key Value Stores

These are storage systems similar to hash tables where key-value pairs are stored. They are essential for handling large amounts of unstructured data efficiently.

### Blob Storage

Blob storage (Binary Large Objects) is used for storing large amounts of unstructured data, such as videos and images.

### Databases

Databases are organized collections of data that allow for easy access, management, and modification.

### Rate Limiters

Rate limiters control the maximum number of requests a service can handle, ensuring stability and performance under high load.

### Monitoring Systems

Monitoring systems allow administrators to track infrastructure metrics such as bandwidth, CPU usage, and network performance, ensuring the system remains healthy and responsive.

### Distributed System Messaging Queue

This component acts as a medium for transactions between producers and consumers in a distributed system.

### Distributed Unique ID Generator

In large distributed systems, a unique ID generator assigns tags to distinguish multiple concurrent tasks.

### Distributed Search

Crucial for retrieving information across websites, distributed search systems help users find what they need efficiently.

### Distributed Logging Services

These services trace sequences of events from end to end, providing insights into system performance and troubleshooting issues.

### Distributed Task Scheduler

A scheduler manages computational resources such as CPU, memory, and storage, ensuring efficient task execution.

## System Design Life Cycle (SDLC)

The System Design Life Cycle (SDLC) outlines the steps involved in designing and developing a system, whether it's a software application, hardware solution, or an integrated system combining both. The phases guide engineers through creating a system that meets user needs and organizational goals, ensuring the end product is reliable, scalable, and maintainable.

### Phases of the SDLC

1. **Planning**
2. **Feasibility Study**
3. **System Design**
4. **Implementation**
5. **Testing**
6. **Deployment**
7. **Maintenance and Support**

## System Architecture

Software architecture defines how the components of a design are depicted and deployed. It serves as the skeleton of a software system, detailing components, abstraction levels, and other critical aspects. Understanding system architecture helps in laying out the business logic and goals of a project clearly.

### System Architecture Patterns

Different predefined organizations of components in software architectures are known as architecture patterns. Each pattern is designed to solve specific problems in software architecture. Common patterns include:

- **Layered Pattern**
- **Client-Server Pattern**
- **Event-Driven Pattern**
- **Microkernel Pattern**
- **Microservices Pattern**

## Modularity and Interfaces in Systems Design

### Modular Design

Modular design involves integrating smaller, independent elements to create a finished product. For instance, a car can be divided into simpler components, each developed and produced separately, then assembled into the final product.

### Interfaces in System Design

Interfaces are the areas where users interact with the system. They include screen displays, forms for data entry, and system reports, facilitating system navigation and data collection.

## Evolution/Upgrade/Scale of an Existing System

With increasing tech usage, scalable systems are essential. If a system is not scalable, it may crash with an increasing user base.

### Upgrading Specifications

This involves improving the existing system's components, such as upgrading RAM and disk size, without changing the overall scalability or network bandwidth.

### Creating a Distributed System

Connecting multiple systems to handle increased load and ensure availability. This is known as horizontal scaling, distributing tasks across multiple systems.

## How Data Flows Between Systems

Data flows between systems are represented by Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs). DFDs graphically represent the flow of data through a system, showing how it is divided into smaller portions and highlighting the data flow between these parts.

### Components of a DFD

- **Square**: Represents the source or destination of data.
- **Arrow**: Identifies data flow.
- **Circle/Bubble**: Represents a process transforming incoming data flow into outgoing data.
- **Open Rectangle**: Denotes a data store or temporary repository.

## System Design Example: Airline Reservation System

### Context-Level Flow Diagram

To understand the components and design of an Airline Reservation System, review its context-level flow diagram.

### DFD Explanation

- **Passenger, Travel Agent, Airline**: Sources across which data migrates.
- **Booking Airline Ticket**: Data transmission from Passenger to Travel Agent and Airline.
- **Seat Availability Check**: Request for preferences and flight booking.
- **Ticketing**: Request fulfillment if seats are available.
- **Reservation**: Handling requests when no tickets are available.

## Conclusion

System design is a critical aspect of developing robust and scalable systems. It involves a thorough understanding of user requirements and translating them into a detailed blueprint. By mastering system design, developers can ensure that their systems are efficient, reliable, and adaptable to changing needs, ultimately leading to successful and sustainable solutions.
