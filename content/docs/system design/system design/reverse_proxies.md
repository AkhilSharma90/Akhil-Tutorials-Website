A reverse proxy is a server that sits in front of web servers and forwards client requests to those web servers. Unlike a forward proxy, which sits in front of client machines and forwards client requests to the web servers, a reverse proxy serves as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from one or more servers. It helps enhance security, performance, and reliability of the web services it supports.

## What is a Proxy Server?

A forward proxy, often simply called a proxy, is a server that acts as an intermediary between a group of client machines and the wider internet. When these clients make requests to internet resources, the proxy intercepts these requests, processes them, and then forwards them to the appropriate web servers. The web servers' responses are then sent back to the proxy, which forwards them to the clients.

### Example Scenario for Forward Proxy:

<!-- ![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/SOub4UD.png) -->
<blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="SOub4UD" data-context="false" ><a href="//imgur.com/SOub4UD"></a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

1. **Computer A (Client)**: A user's home computer.
2. **Computer B (Forward Proxy Server)**: The proxy server that intercepts and forwards requests.
3. **Computer C (Origin Server)**: The server where the website data is stored.

In a typical forward proxy setup, the communication flow is:

- **Client (A)** sends a request to **Forward Proxy (B)**.
- **Forward Proxy (B)** forwards the request to **Origin Server (C)**.
- **Origin Server (C)** sends the response to **Forward Proxy (B)**.
- **Forward Proxy (B)** sends the response back to **Client (A)**.

### Uses of Forward Proxy:

1. **Bypassing Restrictions**: Users can access restricted content by connecting through a proxy that is not subject to the same restrictions.
2. **Content Filtering**: Organizations can block access to certain websites or content types.
3. **Anonymity**: Users can mask their IP addresses, making it harder to track their online activities.

## How is a Reverse Proxy Different?

A reverse proxy sits in front of one or more web servers, intercepting requests from clients. Unlike a forward proxy, which handles requests from clients and forwards them to servers, a reverse proxy handles requests from clients on behalf of the servers, making it seem like the proxy server is the actual web server.

### Example Scenario for Reverse Proxy:

1. **Computer D (Client)**: Any number of users' home computers.
2. **Computer E (Reverse Proxy Server)**: The proxy server that intercepts and forwards requests.
3. **Computer F (Origin Server)**: One or more servers where the website data is stored.

In a typical reverse proxy setup, the communication flow is:

- **Client (D)** sends a request to **Reverse Proxy (E)**.
- **Reverse Proxy (E)** forwards the request to **Origin Server (F)**.
- **Origin Server (F)** sends the response to **Reverse Proxy (E)**.
- **Reverse Proxy (E)** sends the response back to **Client (D)**.

## Benefits of a Reverse Proxy

### Load Balancing

A reverse proxy can distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed. This improves the performance and reliability of applications, particularly for high-traffic websites.

### Protection from Attacks

By hiding the IP addresses of origin servers, a reverse proxy can protect them from targeted attacks such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Attackers will only see the IP address of the reverse proxy, which typically has stronger security measures.

### Global Server Load Balancing (GSLB)

A reverse proxy can distribute traffic across servers located in different geographical locations. Clients are directed to the nearest server, reducing latency and improving load times.

### Caching

A reverse proxy can cache content, providing quicker responses to clients by serving cached data rather than fetching it from the origin server every time. This improves performance and reduces the load on origin servers.

### SSL Encryption

Reverse proxies can handle SSL encryption and decryption, offloading this resource-intensive task from the origin servers. This ensures secure data transmission while freeing up server resources for other tasks.

## Implementation of a Reverse Proxy

### Building a Reverse Proxy

Some companies choose to build their own reverse proxies, which requires significant investment in software and hardware engineering resources, as well as physical infrastructure.

### Using a CDN Service

A cost-effective and efficient alternative is to use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) service. CDNs provide reverse proxy capabilities along with additional performance and security features. For example, Cloudflare's CDN offers load balancing, DDoS protection, global server load balancing, caching, and SSL encryption, among other benefits.

## Conclusion

A reverse proxy serves as an intermediary between clients and servers, enhancing security, performance, and reliability. By managing traffic and providing features such as load balancing, caching, and SSL encryption, reverse proxies play a crucial role in modern web infrastructure. Whether built in-house or provided by a CDN, reverse proxies are essential for maintaining the efficiency and security of web applications.
