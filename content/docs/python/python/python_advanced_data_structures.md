## Introduction

Advanced data structures are crucial for creating efficient algorithms and applications. Python’s standard library offers several modules that contain advanced data structures which can significantly simplify complex programming tasks.

### Collections Module

The `collections` module provides alternatives to Python’s general purpose built-in containers. We will focus on `Counter`, `deque`, and `OrderedDict`.

#### Counter
`Counter` is a subclass of `dict` that is used to count objects. It simplifies counting and frequency analysis tasks.

```python
from collections import Counter

# Example usage of Counter
words = ["apple", "banana", "apple", "orange", "banana", "apple"]
word_counts = Counter(words)
print(word_counts)  # Counter({'apple': 3, 'banana': 2, 'orange': 1})

# Most common elements
print(word_counts.most_common(2))  # [('apple', 3), ('banana', 2)]
```
`Counter` automatically counts the frequency of each element in the list, providing a dictionary-like object where elements are keys and counts are values. The `most_common()` method returns the most frequent elements.

#### deque
`deque`, pronounced "deck", is a list-optimized container that provides fast appends and pops from both ends.

```python
from collections import deque

# Creating and using deques
d = deque("ghi")  # Make a new deque with three items
for elem in d:  # iterate over the deque's elements
    print(elem.upper())

d.append('j')  # Add to the right
d.appendleft('f')  # Add to the left
print("Deque after additions:", list(d))

d.pop()  # Remove from the right
d.popleft()  # Remove from the left
print("Deque after deletions:", list(d))
```
`deque` supports thread-safe, memory-efficient appends and pops from either side of the deque with approximately the same O(1) performance in either direction.

#### OrderedDict
`OrderedDict` maintains the order of keys as they were initially inserted. This was particularly useful before Python 3.7 introduced regular dicts that preserve order. However, `OrderedDict` still has its uses, such as when reordering dict items is needed.

```python
from collections import OrderedDict

# Maintaining insertion order
ordered_dict = OrderedDict([('red', 1), ('green', 2), ('blue', 3)])
print("OrderedDict:", ordered_dict)

# Reordering an OrderedDict
ordered_dict.move_to_end('red', last=False)
print("OrderedDict after moving 'red' to the end:", ordered_dict)
```

### heapq for Priority Queues

The `heapq` module provides an implementation of the heap queue algorithm, also known as the priority queue algorithm.

#### Using heapq
```python
import heapq

# Example of a priority queue
numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5]
heapq.heapify(numbers)  # Transform list into a heap
print("Heap:", numbers)

heapq.heappush(numbers, 7)  # Add element
print("Heap after adding an element:", numbers)

smallest = heapq.heappop(numbers)  # Pop the smallest item
print("Smallest element:", smallest)
print("Heap after popping the smallest element:", numbers)
```
`heapq` transforms a regular list into a heap where the smallest element is always at the index 0. This is useful for tasks where you continually need to access and remove the smallest element without performing a full sort.

### Conclusion

Understanding and utilizing advanced data structures like those in the `collections` module and the `heapq` module can significantly enhance the efficiency and performance of your Python applications. This guide has provided a detailed look into some of these structures, illustrating their usage and benefits in real-world scenarios.
