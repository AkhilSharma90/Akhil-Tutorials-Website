## Introduction to Elm

Elm is a delightful language for reliable web applications. It compiles to JavaScript, but it's much more than just a language; it's a framework for making web development more robust and
pleasant. One of the most striking features of Elm is its emphasis on simplicity and quality
tooling, making it an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced developers.

## Why Elm?

**Simplicity and Safety**

Elm's syntax is clean and easy to understand, making it an ideal starting point for those new to
programming. It avoids runtime errors in your application, thanks to its strong type system and
compiler checks. This means fewer crashes and unexpected behavior in your applications.

**Performance and Maintainability**
Elm applications are known for their performance. The language is designed for easy
refactoring and maintainability, so your codebase remains manageable, even as it grows in
complexity.
**Great Developer Experience**

Elm provides a friendly compiler that not only catches errors but also suggests how to fix them.
This feature, along with a strong set of tools and a helpful community, makes learning and
developing with Elm a rewarding experience.
In the following sections, we will delve into Elm's setup, basic syntax, core concepts, and some
advanced features, all accompanied by practical code examples. This journey will equip you
with the foundational knowledge and skills to start building your own Elm applications.

## Getting Started with Elm

Elm provides a smooth entry point for beginners, and setting it up is straightforward. Here's how
you can get started with Elm and write your first Elm program.

**Installation and Setup**

1. Install Elm: Visit Elm's official website and follow the instructions to install Elm for your
   operating system.2. Editor Setup: For a better experience, use an editor with Elm support, like Visual Studio
   Code. Install the Elm language support extensions for syntax highlighting and
   auto-completion.
2. Create Your First Elm File: Create a new file with the extension .elm. For instance,
   HelloWorld.elm.

## Basic Syntax and Structure

Elm is a purely functional language, and its syntax reflects this. Here's a quick overview:
● Comments: Single-line comments start with --, and multi-line comments are enclosed in
{- and -}.
● Functions: Functions are central in Elm. A simple function to add two numbers looks like
this:

```elm
add a b = a + b
```

●
●
Variables: Elm uses immutable variables. Once a variable is declared, its value can't
change.
Types: Types are explicit in Elm, ensuring code reliability.

## "Hello, World!" in Elm

Let's write the classic "Hello, World!" program. Create a file named HelloWorld.elm and write the
following code:

```elm
module HelloWorld exposing (..)
import Html exposing (text)
main =
text "Hello, World!"
```

This program uses the Html module to display text. The main function is the entry point of every
Elm program. Here, it's using text from the Html module to render "Hello, World!" on the screen.
To run this program:
​ Open your terminal or command prompt.
​ Navigate to the directory containing your HelloWorld.elm file.
​ Run elm reactor.
​ Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8000.
​ Click on HelloWorld.elm to see your program running.

## Example Code using elm
Each section of the code is explained through the comments

```elm
-- This is a single line comment.

{-
This is a multi-line comment.
It is {- nestable. -}
-}

-- Here we define a value named `greeting`. The type is inferred as a `String`.
greeting =
    "Hello World!"

 -- It is best to add type annotations to top-level declarations.
hello : String
hello =
    "Hi there."

-- Functions are declared the same way, with arguments following the function name.
add x y =
    x + y

-- Again, it is best to add type annotations.
hypotenuse : Float -> Float -> Float
hypotenuse a b =
    sqrt (a^2 + b^2)

-- We can create lambda functions with the `\[arg] -> [expression]` syntax.
hello : String -> String
hello = \s -> "Hi, " ++ s

-- Function declarations may have the anonymous parameter names denoted by `_`, which are matched but not used in the body. 
const : a -> b -> a
const k _ = k

-- Functions are also curried; here we've curried the multiplication 
-- infix operator with a `2`
multiplyBy2 : number -> number
multiplyBy2 =
    (*) 2

-- If-expressions are used to branch on `Bool` values
absoluteValue : number -> number
absoluteValue number =
    if number < 0 then negate number else number

 -- Records are used to hold values with named fields
book : { title : String, author : String, pages : Int }
book =
    { title = "Steppenwolf"
    , author = "Hesse"
    , pages = 237 
    }

-- Record access is done with `.`
title : String
title =
    book.title

-- Record access `.` can also be used as a function
author : String
author =
    .author book

-- We can create tagged unions with the `type` keyword.
-- The following value represents a binary tree.
type Tree a
    = Empty
    | Node a (Tree a) (Tree a)

-- It is possible to inspect these types with case-expressions.
depth : Tree a -> Int
depth tree =
    case tree of
        Empty ->  0
        Node _ left right ->
            1 + max (depth left) (depth right)
```
