### Explanation of Macros in Huff

Macros in Huff are one of its most distinctive and powerful features. They allow you to define reusable code blocks that can be invoked within your contract. This feature helps in organizing complex logic, reducing redundancy, and making contracts more readable. Unlike functions in high-level languages, macros do not have their own execution context; they are essentially inlined wherever they are called.

### How to Create and Use Macros Effectively

Creating a macro in Huff involves a few key steps:

1. **Define the Macro**: Start with `#define macro MACRO_NAME()`.
2. **Specify Stack Changes**: Indicate how the macro affects the EVM stack using `takes (n) returns (m)`, where `n` and `m` are the number of stack elements taken and returned by the macro.
3. **Write the Macro Body**: Include the EVM opcodes and other macro calls that make up the macro's logic.

Effective use of macros often involves breaking down contract logic into smaller, reusable parts. This approach can significantly optimize gas usage and enhance contract readability.

### Code Example: Implementing a Macro

Let's create a macro that doubles a value on the stack:

```huff
#define macro DOUBLE() = takes (1) returns (1) {
    dup1 // Duplicate the top stack item
    add  // Add the top two stack items
}
```

This macro takes one value from the stack, duplicates it, and then adds the two top stack items, effectively doubling the original value.

### Incorporating Macros into Contracts

Macros are incorporated into Huff contracts by calling them within other macros. For example, you can use the `DOUBLE` macro in a contract's main logic:

```huff
#define macro MAIN() = takes (0) returns (0) {
    5         // Push the value 5 onto the stack
    DOUBLE()  // Call the DOUBLE macro
    // Continue with additional contract logic...
}
```

In this example, the `MAIN` macro uses `DOUBLE` to double the number 5.
