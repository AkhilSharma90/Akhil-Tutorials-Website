## Practical Applications and Best Practices

### Real-World Applications of Erlang

Erlang's unique features make it a preferred choice in several critical industries:

**Case Studies**

Notable examples include WhatsApp for instant messaging, Ericsson for telecommunications, and Klarna for online payments. These applications leverage Erlang's ability to handle massive concurrency and maintain high availability.

**Industry Use-Cases**

Erlang is extensively used in sectors requiring scalable, fault-tolerant systems, such as banking, e-commerce, telecommunication, and cloud computing.

### Best Practices in Erlang Programming

Adopting best practices is crucial for writing efficient, maintainable, and scalable Erlang code:

**Code Organization**

Structuring code into modules, following OTP design principles, and maintaining clear documentation.

**Performance Optimization**

Profiling and optimizing code, efficiently handling memory and process management, and understanding the nuances of Erlang's garbage collection.

**Testing and Documentation**

Writing comprehensive tests using tools like EUnit and ensuring thorough documentation for maintainability and ease of collaboration.

**Code Example: Code Organization and Documentation**

```erlang
-module(my_module).
-author("Your Name").

%% @doc This function adds two numbers.
%% @spec add(Number1, Number2) -> Number when
%%       Number1, Number2, Number :: number().
add(Number1, Number2) ->
    Number1 + Number2.
```
