**Vulnerable SSL/TLS Versions**

| Issue | Severity | Attack pre-requisites | Impact | Description | References |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SSLv2 | Medium | MITM | Exposure and tampering in real-time | First released version of SSL that does not protect against MITM. 
Also susceptible to Bleichenbacher '98 (see BB98) attack to encrypt and 
decrypt data with server's RSA private key. |  |
| SSLv3 | Low | BEASTly, CBC | Decryption of data | POODLE attack, allows decryption of data through a padding oracle 
attack. BEAST, allows decryption of data through a padding oracle 
attack. Requires BEASTly attack model. |  |
| TLSv1.0 | Low | BEASTly, CBC | Decryption of data | see BEAST |  |
| DROWN | Medium | Adjacent network, RSA, key reuse across TLS versions | Decryption of data | BB98, as applied to SSLv2, to recover session keys encrypted with 
the server's RSA private key, can be used in conjunction with key reuse 
across different available versions of SSL/TLS to recover session keys 
from captured sessions and decrypt application data. | https://drownattack.com/ |

**Vulnerable cipher suites**

| Issue | Severity | Attack pre-requisites | Impact | Description | References |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| NULL | High | Adjacent network | Exposure and tampering in real-time | No encryption. Should only be enabled in testing. Disables encryption and integrity entirely. |  |
| EXPORT | High | Adjacent network | Exposure and tampering in real-time | Intentionally weakened ciphers that only provide 40 bits of 
security. With specialized hardware, real-time cracking may be possible,
 so long-lived sessions may be MITM'd invisibly. These ciphers are 
sometimes exploitable even if the client does not support or choose 
EXPORT-grade ciphers due to the nature of the algorithms themselves. 
(see FREAK, Logjam) | https://www.mitls.org/pages/attacks/SMACK#freak, https://weakdh.org/ |
| DES | High | Adjacent network | Decryption of data, but not in real time. | Old cipher with small key size designed at a time when computing 
resources weren't enough to brute force DES keys efficiently. Can be 
brute forced in roughly a week with a machine costing $10,000. | http://www.sciengines.com/copacobana/ |
| RC4 | Low | BEASTly | Partial decryption of data. | Known serious biases in keystream output can be used to decrypt 
data, and given enough data, recover encryption keys. The IETF has 
prohibited the use of RC4 in any standards-compliant version of TLS, and
 Mozilla and Microsoft have recommended against any use of RC4. | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC4#Security |
| 3DES/DES-CBC3/DES-EDE/Triple DES | Low | BEASTly, Old server version, Large amounts of data | Partial decryption of data. | Meet-in-the-middle attack reduces effective key strength to slightly above 112 bits. (see also SWEET32) | https://sweet32.info/ |
| Blowfish | Low | BEASTly, Old server version, CBC, Large amounts of data | Decryption of pseudo-random blocks of data. | See SWEET32. |  |
| MD5 | Info | Theoretical | Tampering | MD5 has significant known collision weaknesses, with further advances HMAC-MD5 may be exploitable. | https://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/ |
| SHA-1 / SHA | Info | Theoretical | Tampering | SHA-1 has known collision weaknesses, with further advances HMAC-SHA may be exploitable. | https://shattered.io/ |
| Anonymous DH/ECDH | Medium | MITM | Decryption and tampering in real time | Anonymous Diffie-Hellman and its elliptic curve variant is 
susceptible to a MITM attack that allows an attacker to establish an 
encrypted channel with both sides of the conversation and observe and 
modify traffic invisibly and in real time. |  |
| SWEET32 | Low | BEASTly, Old server version, CBC, Large amounts of data | Decryption of pseudo-random blocks of data. | Random collisions in encrypted block values plus known plaintext for
 one of the two colliding blocks results in decryption of the other, 
requires hundreds of gigabytes of data for reasonable chance of success,
 plus large amounts of attacker-provided data. | https://sweet32.info/ |

**Certificate issues**

| Issue | Severity | Attack pre-requisites | Impact | Description | References |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Self-signed certificate / Untrusted issuer | Medium | Client/user acceptance, MITM | Decryption and tampering in real-time | The certificate is not signed by an entity in any known trust store.
 There is no way to validate that the signing authority is valid. see 
User SSL/TLS Warnings. |  |
| Certificate subject mismatch | Medium | Client/user acceptance, MITM | Decryption and tampering in real-time | The certificate is not valid for the subject it is being used to protect. see User SSL/TLS Warnings. |  |
| Weak signature algorithm | Medium | Client/user acceptance, MITM | Decryption and tampering in real-time | The certificate uses a known weak signing algorithm such as MD5 or 
SHA-1 in its digital signature. Successful bait-and-switch attacks 
against signing authorities have been demonstrated to generate 
intermediate Certificate Authorities, compromising the chain of trust 
and therefore, all SSL/TLS traffic. | https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-tls-md5-sha1-deprecate-00.html |
| Revoked certificate | Medium | Client/user acceptance, MITM | Decryption and tampering in real-time | A certificate in the chain of trust was revoked, and can no longer be trusted. see User SSL/TLS Warnings. |  |
| Debian faulty PRNG key | High | Adjacent network | Decryption and tampering in real-time | The key used in the certificate was generated with a version of 
Debian known to have serious vulnerabilities in its PRNG. Since only 
65535 possible keys can be generated with such a PRNG, it is possible to
 keep a library of all possible key pairs, identify the key pair based 
on the server's presented public key, and decrypt and modify all traffic
 in real-time using the corresponding private key. | https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/2008/msg00152.html |
| Expired certificate | Low | Client/user acceptance | Decryption and tampering in real-time | The certificate has passed its validity period and can no longer be 
trusted. Validity period for certificates attempt to limit the time 
attackers can spend trying to brute force a private key. see User 
SSL/TLS Warnings. |  |
| 1024-bit RSA key | Low | Adjacent network, significant resources | Decryption and tampering in real-time | The certificate has a 1024-bit modulus. Given nation-state or 
organized crime level resources, a single 1024-bit public key could be 
factored to recover the private key in a short enough time to present a 
practical threat, as of this writing. Over time, as computing power 
grows, the feasibility of this attack will only grow. |  |
| 768-bit or lower RSA key | High | Adjacent network | Decryption and tampering in real-time | The certificate has a 768-bit modulus, or smaller. This is small 
enough to allow an attacker to factor the modulus and recover the 
private key using off-the-shelf hardware for a modest price. |  |

**Implementation-specific vulnerabilities**

| Issue | Severity | Attack pre-requisites | Impact | Description | References |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| HeartBleed | Critical | Old server version | Disclosure of server memory. | Exploits buffer overread in heartbeat TLS extension to read out 
server memory adjacent to buffer, often revealing request/response data 
or even private key material if server has just been restarted. | https://heartbleed.com/ |
| Lucky 13 | Low | BEASTly, Old server version, CBC | Partial decryption of data. | Exploits timing issue in MAC verification of certain vulnerable implementations to decrypt certain parts of encrypted data. |  |
| ROBOT | Medium | Old server version, Adjacent network, RSA | Encryption and decryption with server RSA private key | A small variation on Bleichenbacher's 1998 attack on RSA enables attacks on vulnerable TLS implementations. (see BB98) | https://robotattack.org/ |
| OpenSSL CCS Injection | Medium | Old server version, MITM | Decryption and tampering in real-time | The ChangeCipherSpec (CCS) message in the TLS handshake causes keys 
to be finalized. This should only occur once key material has been fully
 exchanged, but old versions of OpenSSL did not properly ensure this was
 the case. An attacker can cause keys to be generated using only public 
material by injecting CCS messages into TLS handshakes prematurely, then
 decrypt and modify traffic using the keys, which can be generated due 
to knowledge of the public key material used to generate them. | https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/06/05/earlyccs.html |

**Configuration issues**

| Issue | Severity | Attack pre-requisites | Impact | Description | References |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CRIME | Medium | BEASTly, Old client version | Decryption of request data. | Compression oracle attack, applied to compressed and then encrypted 
HTTP requests where an attacker can obtain the encrypted data and 
measure its length. (see Compression Oracle) |  |
| TIME | Low | BEASTly, Old client version | Decryption of request data. | CRIME, but based on timing side channel. (see Compression Oracle, CRIME) |  |
| BREACH | Low | BEASTly, Old server version | Decryption of response data. | Compression oracle attack, applied to compressed and then encrypted 
HTTP responses. If an attacker using the BEASTly attack model against an
 application that reflects user input, the response data can be 
recovered. (see Compression Oracle) |  |
| No TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV | Low | MITM, other vulns | Downgrade | Newer versions of SSL/TLS prevent an attacker from modifying the 
list of supported algorithms being sent by the server and client to 
force the use of the weakest possible algorithm. However, without the 
TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV extension, an attacker can force a downgrade to the 
weakest version of SSL/TLS supported by the client and server. |  |
| Insecure renegotiation | Medium | MITM, Old server version, Old client version | Tampering. | An attacker can start a TLS session, sending some data, and then 
initiating a renegotiation when a client connects through a MITM channel
 to stitch the legitimate client into the connection, prepending 
arbitrary data to the request. |  |
